# GooDoc
<i>A flexible and customizable documentation generator for Python source code.</i>

GooDoc generates HTML documentation for your Python source code based on its docstrings.
What defines GooDoc as a unique documentation generator :
- There is no need to write docstrings in a specific way, the docstrings just need <b>to be there</b>.
- GooDoc organizes the docstrings into a simple HTML structure allowing for easy modification and creation of compatible Style Sheets and JS code.
- GooDoc comes with 4 Style Sheets demonstrating the possibilites offered by its simple HTML structure.
- GooDoc comes with an easy-to-use GUI allowing for easy adding of Style Sheets and intuitive documentation configuration.
- GooDoc can alternatively be used to add a Style Sheet to many HTML files at once!
